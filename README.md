# SymmetricAlgorithm---Caesar-Code

The Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another letter located a little further in the alphabet (therefore shifted but always the same for given cipher message). The shift distance is chosen by a number called the offset, which can be right (A to B) or left (B to A).

In this code we have implemented  the Symmetric Algorithm for encryption and decryption of Caesar code. Bytes that are not letters A-Z or a-z should not be changed.
