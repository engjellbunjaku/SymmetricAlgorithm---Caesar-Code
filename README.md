# SymmetricAlgorithm---Caesar-Code

The Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replaced by another letter located a little further in the alphabet (therefore shifted but always the same for given cipher message). The shift distance is chosen by a number called the offset, which can be right (A to B) or left (B to A).
